defmodule Polis.Updates do
  @moduledoc """
  Whether a newer Polis is out, and - only when the arbiter says so -
  getting it.

  ## What it does by itself: one small question

  Every half hour (`Polis.Updates.Checker`) the station asks GitHub for the
  latest release of this program: one request, a few kilobytes, with the
  ETag of the last answer so that "nothing changed" costs nothing. That is
  all it ever does unasked. Offline, a timeout and GitHub's rate limit are
  the same answer - nothing to show - and none of them is an error an
  arbiter has to read in the middle of a round.

  The question itself is a setting (`update_check`: `"ask"` or `"never"`,
  the page's "This program"). There is no third value: nothing is ever installed
  without a person saying yes.

  ## What it does when told to

  The hall may be on a phone's hotspot, and a round may be coming out of
  the printer. So the notice says how big the download is before anything
  is fetched, and `apply/1` refuses while a job is printing - an update
  stops the program for about a minute, and a job cut off halfway is a
  pairings list with half the boards on it. The refusal can be overridden,
  by a second, explicit yes (`force: true`), and by nothing else. Jobs that
  are only waiting are not lost by an update: the queue is on disk.

  How it is applied depends on how the program was installed
  (`install_kind/0`):

    * `:velopack` - the Windows installer. This program stops with exit code
      90; `rel/windows/launcher.c`, which started it, sees that code,
      asks Velopack for the update, and starts the new version - or the old
      one again when anything at all went wrong.
    * `:systemd` - the Linux installer. This program writes the version it
      wants into a file; a systemd path unit sees the file and runs
      `/opt/polis/update.sh` as root, which downloads, verifies, switches
      and restarts - or switches back.
    * `:manual` - a portable zip, `Polis.app` on a Mac, a checkout. The
      notice says what to do: on a Mac, replace the app with the new one
      (docs/macos.md says why there is no button there yet).

  Neither the data directory nor anything in it is part of an update on
  either road; see `Polis.DataHome`.
