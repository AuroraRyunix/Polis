  The printer that prints nothing. Each job's PDF and its layout, as the
  JSON the Windows road would draw, are written to `<data>/dry-run/` under
  the job's own name, and the job counts as printed.

  The default in development and in the tests, so that nobody's printer
  wakes up because somebody ran the tests; `POLIS_PRINTER=dry-run` makes a
  release do the same, for a rehearsal. It offers one printer, so that
  everything that needs a printer chosen can be tried: "Dry run".
